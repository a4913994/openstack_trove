    Changed the network mode of database container to "bridge" and exposed the
    service ports. Cloud operator could adjust the iptables to restrict network
    access from the database container to the outside. An example::

      iptables -t filter -I DOCKER-USER 1 -d [restricted-network-range] -i docker0 ! -o docker0 -j REJECT

upgrade:
  - The default value of the trove guest agent config option
    ``[postgresql] backup_docker_image`` is changed to
    ``openstacktrove/db-backup-postgresql:1.1.1``. There is nothing to do if
    the option is not configured explicitly.
